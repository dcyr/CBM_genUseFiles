If the number of repeats can be determined from all distinct values in a field in an SQL query, choose the 'One repeat per unique value in the following field (include ORDER BY)' button, and enter that SQL query.  The values returned from this query must also be the values that each repeat of fields belongs to (eg, SpeciesTypes Softwood, Hardwood, etc.).  This option can return more than one field per row.  In this case, all fields returned will be used to determine which values this repeat of fields belongs to; therefore, only include fields in your SELECT clause that actually IDENTIFY each repeat of fields.  If the number of repeats cannot be known by one of the above two methods, or the number of repeats can vary from record to record (EVER!), then choose the last option, 'Number of repeats per record unknown, or variable'.

"ppTextFileAttribs","ptWizard",0,1,"A record delimiter is usually one or more CRLF characters (carriage-return-line-feed).  If each record in your source text file occupies exactly one line, then enter a '1' in the 'Fixed number of delimiters between each record' field.  If there is more than one CRLF character between records, and that number never changes, enter that number there.  If, on the other hand, there are always the same number lines per record (with multiple CRLF characters between each record), enter that unchanging number of lines in the 'Fixed number of lines per record' field.  Finally, if there are multiple CRLF characters between each record, but the number between each record tends to be inconsistent, choose 'Treat more than one delimiter as a single record break'.  Field delimiters could be commas, pipe characters, spaces, or just about anything.  Whatever delimiter you choose, make sure no field anywhere in your data source contains any field delimiter characters in the data itself, or the Translator will not work.  Also, any delimiter can occur back-to-back anywhere in your data source.  If this means that there is an EMPTY field value between those two delimiters, do NOT check 'Treat multiple delimiter characters as single delimiter'.  If however, multiple delimiter characters grouped together ARE a field delimiter, DO check 'Treat multiple delimiter characters as single delimiter'.  For example, your data source may contain data lined up in columns, and separated by spaces (rather than tabs).  But since the columns are lined up, and the data in them has random lengths, each set of spaces, no matter how many, is treated as ONE delimiter.  Finally, if you use spaces as a delimiter, and your data source has ANY text fields in which there is ANY possibility that space characters could appear in the data itself, then that data source should have a special text field delimiter, such as double quotes, for example.  Otherwise, spaces in the data itself will appear to the Translator to be the beginning of a new column!"
