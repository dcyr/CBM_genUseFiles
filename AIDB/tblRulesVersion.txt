4,"Updated tblFluxIndicators","Six new fields of Biopool To Air is added to tblFluxIndicators. There are also sign changes to certain fields. Also there will be values for both distTypeID = 0 and distTypeID > 0; The reason for adding a new version as oppose to fixing version3 is to minimize the effect of these changes to our users (beta Testers); It is very likely that by this point they have created many  views on tblFluxIndicators which because of the Rules generated on Version 3 produce the right result. The new modifications however will result their views to generate invalid results (their queries on V3.FluxInd are multiplied by -1; This multiplication will be removed because of the new modification. So it's better to move this new modification to a new version keeping the old ones safe)",1,1,"4.0"
